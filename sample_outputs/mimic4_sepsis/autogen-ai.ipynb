      "\n",
      "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Early detection and treatment are crucial. Certain blood chemistry lab tests can help in predicting the onset of sepsis by indicating infection, inflammation, organ function, and electrolyte imbalances.\n",

      "From the provided list, the following lab tests are particularly relevant for predicting the onset of sepsis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Anion Gap**: High levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, common in sepsis.\n",
      "- **Bicarbonate (HCO3)**: Low levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, which is seen in sepsis.\n",
      "- **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**: Elevated levels can indicate renal dysfunction, which can be a complication of sepsis.\n",
      "- **Creatinine**: Increased levels indicate renal impairment, which can be caused by sepsis.\n",
      "- **Glucose**: Hyperglycemia can be a response to stress, including sepsis, even in patients without diabetes.\n",
      "- **Sodium**: Abnormal levels can indicate dysregulation of the body's water balance, which can be affected by sepsis.\n",
      "- **Potassium**: Abnormal levels can be a sign of renal dysfunction or metabolic acidosis, both of which can be related to sepsis.\n",

      "The dimensionality reduction process was successfully executed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method was chosen because it is highly effective in reducing the dimensionality of data sets by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables (principal components) that are linearly uncorrelated and retain most of the variance present in the original dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a brief explanation of the process and the outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **PCA**: PCA was applied to the dataset after standardizing the features. Standardization is crucial for PCA since it is sensitive to the variances of the initial variables. By standardizing, we ensure that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Variance Retained**: The PCA was configured to retain 95% of the variance in the original data. This means the transformation was aimed at keeping the most informative components of the data while significantly reducing the number of features.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Outcome**: The original dataset contained 142 features. After applying PCA with the goal of retaining 95% of the variance, the number of features was reduced to 53. This substantial reduction in dimensionality can significantly improve the efficiency of subsequent analyses, such as classification, while still preserving the essence of the original dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Feature Names**: The columns of the reduced dataset were named as strings representing their index. This is a common practice since the principal components generated by PCA do not correspond directly to the original features but rather to their linear combinations. Therefore, the names of the reduced features are indices (0, 1, 2, ..., 52).\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduced dataset, now with 53 features, is expected to maintain the core information necessary for accurately predicting outcomes, such as the onset of sepsis from blood chemistry lab tests, with improved computational efficiency and potentially better model performance due to the reduction of noise and less relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "This reduction is particularly valuable in contexts like healthcare data analysis, where the interpretability of the model can be secondary to its predictive performance and efficiency, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. The reduced dataset has been saved to 'data/reduced_features_labels.parquet', ready for further analysis or model training.\n",

       "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Early detection and treatment are crucial. Certain blood chemistry lab tests can help in predicting the onset of sepsis by indicating infection, inflammation, organ function, and electrolyte imbalances.\n",

       "From the provided list, the following lab tests are particularly relevant for predicting the onset of sepsis:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Anion Gap**: High levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, common in sepsis.\n",
       "- **Bicarbonate (HCO3)**: Low levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, which is seen in sepsis.\n",
       "- **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**: Elevated levels can indicate renal dysfunction, which can be a complication of sepsis.\n",
       "- **Creatinine**: Increased levels indicate renal impairment, which can be caused by sepsis.\n",
       "- **Glucose**: Hyperglycemia can be a response to stress, including sepsis, even in patients without diabetes.\n",
       "- **Sodium**: Abnormal levels can indicate dysregulation of the body's water balance, which can be affected by sepsis.\n",
       "- **Potassium**: Abnormal levels can be a sign of renal dysfunction or metabolic acidosis, both of which can be related to sepsis.\n",

       "\n",

       "- **Outcome**: The original dataset contained 142 features. After applying PCA with the goal of retaining 95% of the variance, the number of features was reduced to 53. This substantial reduction in dimensionality can significantly improve the efficiency of subsequent analyses, such as classification, while still preserving the essence of the original dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Feature Names**: The columns of the reduced dataset were named as strings representing their index. This is a common practice since the principal components generated by PCA do not correspond directly to the original features but rather to their linear combinations. Therefore, the names of the reduced features are indices (0, 1, 2, ..., 52).\n",
       "\n",
       "The reduced dataset, now with 53 features, is expected to maintain the core information necessary for accurately predicting outcomes, such as the onset of sepsis from blood chemistry lab tests, with improved computational efficiency and potentially better model performance due to the reduction of noise and less relevant information.\n",

       "Based on the classification reports generated for each model, we can analyze the performance of each classifier on the testing data. The key metrics in the classification report are precision, recall, f1-score, and support, which are defined as follows:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It indicates the quality of the positive class predictions.\n",
       "- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It measures the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.\n",
       "- **F1-Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. It takes both false positives and false negatives into account. An F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n",
       "- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Analysis of Each Model:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **DecisionTreeClassifier and MLPClassifier** showed a very high precision for the negative class (0) but failed to predict the positive class (1) correctly, resulting in a precision of 0 for the positive class. This indicates that these models are highly biased towards the majority class and are not suitable for imbalanced datasets like this one.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **RandomForestClassifier** also showed a similar pattern to the DecisionTreeClassifier and MLPClassifier, with high precision for the negative class but a complete failure to predict the positive class.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **LogisticRegression** managed to predict some of the positive class correctly but with a very low recall and precision for the positive class, indicating a poor performance on the minority class but better than the previously mentioned models.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **GradientBoostingClassifier** showed a slight improvement in predicting the positive class compared to some models but still performed poorly on the positive class with very low precision and recall.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **KNeighborsClassifier** showed some ability to predict the positive class with a recall and precision higher than some other models but still not satisfactory.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Best Performing Model:\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the context of predicting the onset of sepsis, it is crucial to have a model that can accurately identify positive cases (condition present) even if it means accepting some false positives. In this scenario, **LogisticRegression** appears to be the best model among the ones tested, as it has the highest recall for the positive class among all models, despite its low precision. This model has shown some capability to identify positive cases, which is critical in medical predictions like sepsis onset, where missing a positive case can have severe consequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, it's important to note that all models performed poorly on the positive class, which could be due to the imbalance in the dataset or the complexity of the task. Further steps could include applying techniques to handle imbalanced data, such as oversampling the minority class, using class weights, or exploring more complex models and feature engineering to improve the prediction of the positive class.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "\n",
       "The LogisticRegression model, despite its limitations, performed relatively better in terms of recall for the positive class, making it the most suitable choice among the tested models for this specific task. However, there is a significant room for improvement, and further experimentation with data preprocessing, model tuning, and exploring advanced models is recommended to achieve better performance, especially for the positive class prediction in this highly imbalanced dataset.\n",
