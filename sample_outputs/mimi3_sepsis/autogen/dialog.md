You are a Healthcare Specialist. Given the medical condition, Sepsis, what are the key indicators and criteria based on blood chemisty lab tests that can be use to predict the onset of the medical condition. 
    - Please don't use any web scraping or external data sources.
    - Only include the chemistry lab tests types that are in the following list (lab_test_types):

['albumin', 'globulin', 'total_protein', 'aniongap', 'bicarbonate', 'bun', 'calcium', 'chloride', 'creatinine', 'glucose', 'sodium', 'potassium'] 

Using a Python code block (research.py) Save your findings to 'data/lab_test_types.json' as an array of lab test types.

## Healthcare Specialist (AI Assistant) $\Rightarrow$ User
To address the task of identifying key indicators and criteria based on blood chemistry lab tests for predicting the onset of Sepsis, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Indicators**: Based on medical knowledge, we'll identify which lab tests from the provided list are relevant for predicting Sepsis. Sepsis is a condition that can affect various organ systems and is characterized by an inflammatory response to infection. Blood chemistry lab tests can provide critical information about the body's response to infection and organ function.

2. **Save Findings**: After identifying the relevant lab tests, we'll save this information to a JSON file as requested.

Given the list of lab tests:
- Albumin
- Globulin
- Total Protein
- Anion Gap
- Bicarbonate
- BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
- Calcium
- Chloride
- Creatinine
- Glucose
- Sodium
- Potassium

**Identifying Key Indicators for Sepsis**:
- **Anion Gap**: High levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, common in sepsis.
- **Bicarbonate**: Low levels can be a sign of metabolic acidosis in sepsis.
- **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**: Elevated levels may indicate renal dysfunction, which can occur in sepsis.
- **Creatinine**: Increased levels can indicate renal impairment, a complication of sepsis.
- **Glucose**: Hyperglycemia can occur in sepsis even without diabetes.
- **Sodium**: Abnormal levels may indicate dysregulation of water balance, which can be affected by sepsis.
- **Potassium**: Abnormal levels can occur in sepsis, indicating renal dysfunction or acid-base disturbances.

Based on this understanding, we'll now write a Python script to save these findings to 'data/lab_test_types.json'.

```python
# filename: research.py
import json

# List of lab test types relevant for predicting the onset of Sepsis
relevant_lab_tests = [
    'aniongap',
    'bicarbonate',
    'bun',
    'creatinine',
    'glucose',
    'sodium',
    'potassium'
]

# Save the findings to a JSON file
with open('data/lab_test_types.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(relevant_lab_tests, file)

print("Relevant lab test types for predicting Sepsis have been saved to 'data/lab_test_types.json'.")
```

Please save this code to `research.py` and execute it. This will create the `data/lab_test_types.json` file with the array of relevant lab test types for predicting Sepsis.

This code performs dimensionality reduction on a dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was chosen because it is a widely used technique for reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance in the dataset. It works by identifying the directions (principal components) that maximize the variance in the data. By projecting the data onto these directions, PCA reduces the number of dimensions while preserving as much information as possible.

The code first loads the dataset from a parquet file and splits it into features and labels. It then standardizes the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is a common requirement for many machine learning algorithms, including PCA, to perform well. PCA is applied to the standardized features, retaining enough components to explain 95% of the variance in the data. This approach ensures that the reduced dataset still contains most of the information from the original dataset but with fewer features, making it easier to process and analyze.

The reduced features are combined with the labels into a new dataframe, which is then saved to a new parquet file. Finally, the script prints the original and reduced number of features, providing insight into the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction process.

Regarding the specific features retained, PCA transforms the original features into a new set of features (principal components), which are linear combinations of the original features. Therefore, it does not retain specific original features like anion gap or bicarbonate but instead creates new features that best capture the variance in the dataset. This makes PCA particularly useful for datasets where the features are highly correlated or when the goal is to reduce the dataset's complexity for visualization or to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Original number of features

## AI Engineer (AI Assistant) $\Rightarrow$ User
The execution of the provided Python code successfully performed dimensionality reduction on a dataset initially containing 172 features. After applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the number of features was reduced to 55. This significant reduction in dimensionality, while retaining 95% of the variance in the dataset, demonstrates the effectiveness of PCA in compressing information and simplifying the dataset.

PCA was chosen for its ability to transform the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data. This method is particularly useful in scenarios like the one described, where the dataset might contain many features that contribute to the complexity of machine learning models. By reducing the number of features to 55, PCA helps in making the dataset more manageable and potentially improving the performance of classification models aimed at predicting the onset of conditions like Sepsis, based on key indicators from blood chemistry lab tests.

The reduction to 55 features means that these new features are linear combinations of the original 172 features, including key indicators such as anion gap, bicarbonate, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), creatinine, glucose, sodium, and potassium. Although the original names and direct interpretations of these features are lost in the transformation, the retained principal components still encapsulate the critical information necessary for predictive modeling, making them valuable for further analysis and model training.

This outcome highlights the power of PCA in data preprocessing for machine learning, especially in healthcare analytics, where datasets can be large and complex, yet the need for efficient and accurate predictive models is critical.

The classification reports for each model provide insights into their performance on the test dataset. Here's a summary of what the metrics mean:

- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. High precision relates to a low false positive rate.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It indicates how many of the actual positives our model can capture through labeling it as positive.
- **F1-Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. It takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is a better measure than accuracy for imbalanced classes.
- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. It's useful when the classes are balanced.
- **Macro Avg**: The average precision, recall, and F1-score between classes. Macro average does not take label imbalance into account, so it can be a useful measure when you want to know how the model performs overall across the classes.
- **Weighted Avg**: The weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated for each label, and their average is weighted by the number of true instances for each label. This alters �macro� to account for label imbalance.

### Model Performance Analysis

- **DecisionTreeClassifier** and **KNeighborsClassifier** have relatively lower F1-scores for the minority class (1), indicating challenges in correctly predicting positive cases of the condition.
- **RandomForestClassifier** and **GradientBoostingClassifier** show improved performance but still struggle with the minority class, as seen in their low recall and F1-score for class 1.
- **LogisticRegression** shows a slightly better balance between precision and recall for the minority class compared to some other models but still has a low F1-score.
- **MLPClassifier** has the highest accuracy and shows a relatively better balance in terms of precision and recall for the minority class, suggesting it might be the best performing model among those tested.

### Best Performing Model

Based on the analysis, **MLPClassifier** appears to be the best performing model. It has the highest accuracy (0.857082) and the highest F1-score for the minority class (1) among the models tested. This indicates that it has a better balance in terms of handling both the majority and minority classes, making it potentially more reliable for predicting the onset of conditions like Sepsis based on the reduced feature set derived from blood chemistry lab tests.

The choice of MLPClassifier as the best model is based on its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively, which is crucial in complex medical prediction tasks. Its performance suggests that it could generalize well to unseen data, making it a valuable tool for healthcare analytics in predicting Sepsis.
