By projecting the data onto these directions, PCA reduces the number of dimensions while preserving as much information as possible.\n",

PCA is applied to the standardized features, retaining enough components to explain 95% of the variance in the data. This approach ensures that the reduced dataset still contains most of the information from the original dataset but with fewer features, making it easier to process and analyze.\n",

This makes PCA particularly useful for datasets where the features are highly correlated or when the goal is to reduce the dataset's complexity for visualization or to improve the performance of machine learning models.\n",

After applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the number of features was reduced to 55. This significant reduction in dimensionality, while retaining 95% of the variance in the dataset, demonstrates the effectiveness of PCA in compressing information and simplifying the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "PCA was chosen for its ability to transform the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data. This method is particularly useful in scenarios like the one described, where the dataset might contain many features that contribute to the complexity of machine learning models. By reducing the number of features to 55, PCA helps in making the dataset more manageable and potentially improving the performance of classification models aimed at predicting the onset of conditions like Sepsis, based on key indicators from blood chemistry lab tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduction to 55 features means that these new features are linear combinations of the original 172 features, including key indicators such as anion gap, bicarbonate, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), creatinine, glucose, sodium, and potassium. Although the original names and direct interpretations of these features are lost in the transformation, the retained principal components still encapsulate the critical information necessary for predictive modeling, making them valuable for further analysis and model training.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. High precision relates to a low false positive rate.\n",
       "- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It indicates how many of the actual positives our model can capture through labeling it as positive.\n",
       "- **F1-Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. It takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is a better measure than accuracy for imbalanced classes.\n",
       "- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.\n",
       "- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. It's useful when the classes are balanced.\n",
       "- **Macro Avg**: The average precision, recall, and F1-score between classes. Macro average does not take label imbalance into account, so it can be a useful measure when you want to know how the model performs overall across the classes.\n",
       "- **Weighted Avg**: The weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated for each label, and their average is weighted by the number of true instances for each label. This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **DecisionTreeClassifier** and **KNeighborsClassifier** have relatively lower F1-scores for the minority class (1), indicating challenges in correctly predicting positive cases of the condition.\n",
       "- **RandomForestClassifier** and **GradientBoostingClassifier** show improved performance but still struggle with the minority class, as seen in their low recall and F1-score for class 1.\n",
       "- **LogisticRegression** shows a slightly better balance between precision and recall for the minority class compared to some other models but still has a low F1-score.\n",
       "- **MLPClassifier** has the highest accuracy and shows a relatively better balance in terms of precision and recall for the minority class, suggesting it might be the best performing model among those tested.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Best Performing Model\n",

       "Based on the analysis, **MLPClassifier** appears to be the best performing model. It has the highest accuracy (0.857082) and the highest F1-score for the minority class (1) among the models tested. This indicates that it has a better balance in terms of handling both the majority and minority classes, making it potentially more reliable for predicting the onset of conditions like Sepsis based on the reduced feature set derived from blood chemistry lab tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "The choice of MLPClassifier as the best model is based on its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively, which is crucial in complex medical prediction tasks. Its performance suggests that it could generalize well to unseen data, making it a valuable tool for healthcare analytics in predicting Sepsis.\n",
